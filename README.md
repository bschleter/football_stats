# football_stats


Football stats for 2022 year, cleaned and organized by player for fantasy football analysis. The stats had a lot of N/A, were a bit rough. This will be a starter repository for years to come. It will definitely need work and to be cleaned up, organized better, but more serious work came unto my lap. I am only posting as late in the fantasy season and figured I'd offer for some people to use. The clean data is included for those that was to just grab that and run. 

Included is code that I used to scrape, the sites, as well as the code I used to clean up and save the data. 

I will include more detail instructions of how to run when I get the time. Until then many can figure out easily enough. Here are the basic general instructions:

To gather the stats:

**run the spiders, in terminal:**

```

python scrapy.py

```
**** The clean each sheet with the respective clean data code. Inspect the sheet to review. 
Example: 
``` 

python airyardsclean.py

```


I started this in July 2023, figured in prep but haven't quite finished it all. 

**Note**: as a result I seem to beleive and remember the datamerge.py file not working just yet!!!!!!!

This data/repo will be built upon as I later add my analysis I did on here. However, this data is yours too. Enjoy fruits of my labor.
