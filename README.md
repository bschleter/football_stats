# football_stats


Football stats for 2022 year, cleaned and organized by player for fantasy football analysis. The stats had a lot of N/A, were a bit rough. This will be a starter repository for years to come. 

Included is code that I used to scrape, the sites, as well as the code I used to clean up and save the data. Analysis code will be added after I used up some alpha. 

I started this in July 2023, figured in prep or something. 

This data/repo will be built upon as I later add my analysis I did on here. However, this data is yours too. Enjoy fruits of my labor.
